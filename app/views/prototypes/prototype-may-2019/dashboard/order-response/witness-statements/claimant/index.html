        <h1 class="heading-large">Prove your version of the dispute</h1>

        <p>As the defendant has disputed your claim, you need to produce a statement that uses facts and evidence to help convince the judge that your version of events is the true one.</p>

        <p>This is also known as your 'witness statement'.</p>

        <p>A good witness statement:</p>
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>states facts, not opinions</li>
          <li>clearly reference supporting evidence or sources of facts</li>
          <li>follows a chronological order of events</li>
          <li>is clear, concise and to the point</li>
          <li>covers all the differences between your view of the case and that of the other party</li>
          <li>avoids or explains jargon</li>
          <li>answers any questions a judge might have about your case</li>
          <li>is truthful and not misleading</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>In order to produce your witness statement, we will ask you:</p>
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>for any evidence you want to reference in your statement</li>
          <li>how this evidence and any other facts support your version of the claim</li>
          <li>how this evidence and any other facts dissprove the defendant's version of the claim</li>
          <li>for any additional information</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="form-group">
          <input type="submit" class="button" value="Save and continue"/>
        </div>
