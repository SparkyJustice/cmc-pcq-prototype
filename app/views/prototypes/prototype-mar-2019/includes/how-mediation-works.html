{% if data['post-response'] != 'yes' %}
  <h3 class="heading-medium">A mediator phones you</h3>
  <p>We'll contact you to arrange a phone call with a mediator from the Small Claims Mediation Service.</p>
  <p>The call won't take longer than an hour.</p>

{% endif %}

  <h3 class="heading-medium">You discuss the claim</h3>
  <p>The mediator will:</p>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
      <li>listen to each side separately - you wonâ€™t talk directly to the other side</li>
      <li>ask you to consider what the other side says</li>
      <li>help you reach an agreement, if possible</li>
    </ul>

  <h3 class="heading-medium">After the phone call</h3>
  <p>If mediation is successful you'll make a verbal agreement over the phone. We'll email the agreement to you. You won't have to sign anything but the agreement is binding.</p>

  <p>If either party breaks the terms, the other party can go back to the court to ask for a judgment or hearing.</p>

  <p>If mediation fails and a hearing is needed, any mediation discussions can't be mentioned in court.</p>
