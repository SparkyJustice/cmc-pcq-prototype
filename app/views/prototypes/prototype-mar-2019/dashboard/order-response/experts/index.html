          <h1 class="heading-large">Propose 3 experts</h1>

          <p>You must propose 3 independent experts - the {% if data['party'] == 'defendant' %}claimant{% else %}defendant{% endif %} will then pick one.</p>

          <p>You must not discuss the case with the experts before they're appointed.</p>

          <h3 class="heading-medium">How to choose your experts</h3>

          <p>Make sure the expert you choose meets these conditions:</p>

          <ul class="list list-bullet">
            <li>they know what an expert in a money claim does - ideally they've done it before</li>
            <li>they can write a report about technical details of the case which answers questions from both parties</li>
            <li>they're not a friend or a relative</li>
            <li>the cost isn't out of proportion compared to the total value of the claim</p> 
          </ul>

          <h3 class="heading-medium">How to use the expert</h3>
          <p>Both you and the {% if data['party'] == 'defendant' %}claimant{% else %}defendant{% endif %} can ask questions. The expert will answer these in a report. The judge can use the report to make a ruling.</p>

          <h3 class="heading-medium">Who pays for the expert</h3>
          <p>You and the {% if data['party'] == 'defendant' %}claimant{% else %}defendant{% endif %} share the cost of hiring the expert.</p>
          <p>If you win the case you may be able to recover up to Â£750 of this cost. A judge will rule on this at the end of the hearing.</p>
