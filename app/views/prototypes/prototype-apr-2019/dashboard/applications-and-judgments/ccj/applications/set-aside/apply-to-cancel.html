        <!--<p>You can apply to cancel the CCJ if you did not receive, or did not respond to, the original claim from the-->
          <!--court saying you owed the money. This is known as 'set aside an order'.</p>-->

        <p>Setting aside a CCJ is usually only possible if you have a good reason. For example, you did not receive, or
          did not respond to, the original claim from the court saying you owed the money.</p>

        <p>You’ll have to go to a private hearing at the court to explain why you do not owe the money.</p>

        <!--<p>You'll have to pay a court fee of £255. If you're on a low income you can get <a-->
          <!--href="https://www.gov.uk/get-help-with-court-fees">help with fees</a>.</p>-->

        <h3 class="heading-medium">If your application is successful</h3>
        <p>Your CCJ will be removed from public records. In most cases you'll still have to respond to the claim.</p>

        <p>You can request the claimant refund your £255 fee.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-medium">If your application is unsuccessful</h3>
        <p>You might have to pay the claimant's costs. For example their legal fees or travel costs if it goes to a
          hearing.</p>
        <p>The CCJ will stay on the register for 6 years.</p>
