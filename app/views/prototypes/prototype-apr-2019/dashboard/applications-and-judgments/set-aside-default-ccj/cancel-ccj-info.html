        Remove a County Court Judgment
      </h1>
      <p>If you don't owe the money, you can ask the court to remove a County Court Judgment (CCJ). This is known as getting the judgment 'set aside'.</p>
      <p>You can do this if you did not receive, or did not respond to, the original claim from the court saying you owed the money.</p>
      <p>You must pay a £255 fee to make the request. You might have to go to a hearing.</p>

      <h3 class="heading-medium">If the court removes the CCJ</h3>
      <p>You'll still have to respond to the claim against you.</p>

      <h3 class="heading-medium">If your request is rejected</h3>
      <p>You'll still owe Jan Clark the full £1,500 in the claim.</p>
      <p>You won't get the £255 fee back and your CCJ will remain for 6 years.</p>

      <p><a class="button" href="task-list">Apply to remove the CCJ</a></p>

        <!-- <p>The quickest way to remove the CCJ is for you to contact and settle the claim directly with Jan Clark.</p>
        <p>Your request is more likely to be successful and not require a court hearing if you get Jan Clark to agree the CCJ should be removed. </p> -->

        <br>Keep the CCJ and pay Mrs Jan Clark £1500 in full or in instalments.

      <p><span class="bold">Option 2</span>
        <br>Pay £255 to request a judge to remove this CCJ.
        You may need to provide evidence on why you didn't respond to the claim and go to a court hearing.
        You will have the CCJ until the hearing. Then respond to the claim and probably go to another hearing.
