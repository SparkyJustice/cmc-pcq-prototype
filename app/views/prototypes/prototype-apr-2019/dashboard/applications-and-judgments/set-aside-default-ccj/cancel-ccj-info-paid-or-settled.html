        Remove a County Court Judgment
      </h1>
      <!-- <p>If you've paid the debt or settled with the claimant, you should make sure they tell the court. When they do, the CCJ will be marked as satisfied.</p> -->
      <p>If you don't think the CCJ should have been issued in the first place, you can apply to have it removed. This is known as having it 'set aside'.</p>
      <p>You'll have to go to a hearing. The court will usually only remove a CCJ if it accepts you didn't know about the claim against you.</p>
      <p>You must pay a £255 fee to make the request. You can't get the fee refunded if the court rejects your request.</p>

      <p><a class="button" href="task-list">Apply to cancel the CCJ</a></p>

        <!-- <p>The quickest way to remove the CCJ is for you to contact and settle the claim directly with Jan Clark.</p>
        <p>Your request is more likely to be successful and not require a court hearing if you get Jan Clark to agree the CCJ should be removed. </p> -->

      <p>After you've settle you can pay £255 and <a href="/prototypes/prototype-apr-2019/dashboard/applications-and-judgments/set-aside-default-ccj/how-set-aside-works">request to remove the CCJ</a>.</p>

      <p>Any bailiffs working on this claim will stop you pay for your request.</p> -->

      <!-- <h3 class="heading-medium">If you can't settle directly</h3>

      <p><span class="bold">Option 1</span>
        <br>Keep the CCJ and pay Mrs Jan Clark £1500 in full or in instalments.
        <br> <a href="/prototypes/prototype-apr-2019/defendant/task-list/owe-all">Pay Mrs Jan Clark</a></p>

      <p><span class="bold">Option 2</span>
        <br>Pay £255 to request a judge to remove this CCJ.
        You may need to provide evidence on why you didn't respond to the claim and go to a court hearing.
        You will have the CCJ until the hearing. Then respond to the claim and probably go to another hearing.
