<h2 class="heading-medium">Removing the judgment from the register</h2>

<p>If you pay in full within one month, or you have already paid, you can ask the court to remove the judgment from the register. The judgment won't appear in credit agency searches, though some agencies may not update their records immediately. </p>
<p>If you pay in full in more than one month, you can ask the court to mark the judgment as satisfied. Any credit agency that checks the register will see you've paid the money, though some may not update their records immediately. The judgment will remain on the register for 6 years but it'll be marked as satisfied.</p>
<p>If you need proof that the judgment is cancelled or satisfied you can pay £15 to get a certificate (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-n443-application-for-a-certificate-of-satisfaction-or-cancellation">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-n443-application-for-a-certificate-of-satisfaction-or-cancellation</a>).</p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">If you believe you don't owe the money</h2>
<p>You can apply to the court to set aside the judgment.</p>
<p>To get a judgment set aside, fill in an application notice (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-n244-application-notice">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-n244-application-notice</a>) and send it to the court.</p>
<p>You may have to pay a court fee of £255. You may be apply to get help with court fees.</p>
<p>You'll have to go to a court hearing to explain why you don't owe the money.</p>
<p>If you don't go to the hearing, your application will be rejected and you’ll have to pay the amount in the judgment.</p>
