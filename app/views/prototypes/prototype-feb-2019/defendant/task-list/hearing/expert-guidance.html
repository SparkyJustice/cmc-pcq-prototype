        <h1 class="heading-large">Using an expert in small claims</h1>
        <p>It's rare for judges to allow you to use an expert in a small claim.</p>

        <p>You must ask for permission to use an expert - a judge will then decide whether the expert is necessary and the cost is reasonable.</p>


        <h2 class="heading-medium">When an expert is allowed</h2>
        <p>A judge will only allow you to use an expert if they believe they need the expert's specialist knowledge to rule on the claim.</p>
        <p>For example, they might allow a structural engineer to be used in a claim about building works or a mechanic in a claim about car repairs.</p>
        <p>If a judge allows you to use an expert, you'll usually have to share one expert with the defendant.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-medium">Paying for the expert</h2>
        <p>You and the defendant share the cost of hiring the expert.</p>

        <p>If you win the case you may be able to recover up to Â£750 of this cost. A judge will rule on this at the end of the hearing.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-medium">If you get permission to use an expert</h2>

          <p>First, you need to follow these steps:</p>

        <ol class="list list-number">
          <li>Make a list of 3 independent experts who can provide a written report in return for a fee.</li>
          <li>Avoid discussing the case in detail with the 3 experts.</li>
          <li>Tell the court the names and costs of your 3 experts.</li>
        </ol>

      <p>The defendant then picks one expert from your list. After that, both of you need to follow these steps:</p>

        <ol class="list list-number">
          <li>Provide questions for the expert to answer in a report.</li>
          <li>Pay the expert, sharing the cost equally.</li>
    </ol>

          <p>Finally, you need to:</p>

          <ol class="list list-number">
            <li>Upload the expert's report.</li>
            <li>Send the expert any questions you or the defendant have about the report.</li>
            <li>Upload the expert's response.</li>
      </ol>

        <div class="form-group">
          <input type="submit" class="button" value="Save and continue">
        </div>

      </form>
